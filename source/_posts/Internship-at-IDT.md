After I got champion with Larry in 1st Annual IDT Hackathon, I got a chance to interview with IDT Engineering Department. After a brief interview with Sri, Nathaniel and Chris. I got the internship from IDT. And I worked with Zev team for Boss Money App for 11 weeks. We all interns have a great time there. 

The thing what I achieved at IDT

1. First version Android Widget, iOS Today Extension, SiriKit of Boss Money. And Android Widget and iOS Today Extension already went into production.
2. Migrated deprecated package - React Native Navigator into new one - React Navigation, discussing about current app architecture and raised up some proposals.
3. Appium UI testing parser, exploring more possiblities of UI testing.

At my last day, the very last moment, Zev gave a very firm handshake and very serious look to me, and said: "It is my honor to have you here". I would never forget the very moment.
